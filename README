Vanilla SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
----------------------------------------

Simply drop the VanillaSEO directory into your vanilla forum's plugin directory and enable in dashboard.

Navigate to built in administration interface which can be found under Settings -> Search Engine Optimization. You can edit these configurable items from the backend instead of  "editing in the php file" like most other traditional vanilla plugins.

Official support for this plugin: https://github.com/JamieChung/VanillaSEO
